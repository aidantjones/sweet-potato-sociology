### What the hell is this?

*Sweet Potato Sociology* is a edutainment series with a sociological bent that features topics like:

 - Sex and Gender
 - Masculinity
 - Musicology
 - Japanese Studies
 - Food Studies
 - Media Studies

Why? Because these are all the topics I like. They also provide ample opportunities for original research using inter/multidisciplinary analyses which are novel and fun :)

### Why the hell is this?

I got rejected from grad school and had to channel my sociological thought somewhere. I also like creating polished content as well as eating a certain tuber ;)

### How was this site made?

Glad you asked! This is a static HTML site generated using the wonderful [Eleventy](#). I use [Liquid]() for templating and vanilla CSS for styling. All graphics—save for the vide thumbnails—are vector. This economy results in the entire site being ~600 KB without the thumbnail images (custom fonts comprise most of that anyway).
