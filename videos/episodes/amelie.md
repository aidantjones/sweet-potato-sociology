## Script
### Intro

The 2001 romantic comedy, *Amélie*, enjoyed some critical success. But it is most well-known for being an audience favorite around the globe, playing to our hidden romantic francophile fantasies.

Sure, it has its questionable aspects, particularly its romanticized, sanitized portrayal of Paris. But most seem to view the plot, particularly the main romance, as nothing but wholesome.

But there's more than just a heartwarming story. *Amélie* utilizes its quirky characters for good, imbuing an uncommon humanity into its good characters and punishing the bad. A side effect of this character development is the depiction of a distinct feminism and progressive masculinity.

But before we can get into that, we come to our favorite part: the summary.

### Summary

Amélie is born to peculiar parents who believe that she has a heart defect, damning her to homeschooling. From her homebound boredom comes her odd, mischievous personality. Her mother dies during her childhood, and she is primarily raised by her father as a result.

At 18, she moves to the big city, becomes a waitress at a cafe, a sanctuary for free spirits, and lives a quirky bachelor life. One day, she finds a boy's time capsule in the wall and is off to the races to track down the aged owner, promising herself that if she can fulfill this good deed that she will dedicate her life to doing kind acts.

She succeeds and does well on her promise for a while. During her adventures, she comes across Nino, a similarly quirky cutie who collects discarded photo booth prints.

At one point, he drops his treasured album that Amélie then holds at ransom. She gives him the run around all over Paris as her shyness prevents her from direct confrontation. This bashfulness nearly makes her lose Nino. But a new friend gives her the confidence to pursue Nino and they end up together with the promise of love, a happily ever after.

### Masculinity

#### Collignon and Lucien

But not everyone gets a happily ever after, proven when we look at the story arches of all the men who get significant screen time in the film.

Collignon, the grocer who's downright abusive to his seemingly intellectually disabled assistant, Lucien. Collignon verbally and physically berates him throughout most of the film, enough to definitely qualify as workplace harassment.

Lucien, in contrast, is perhaps the sweetest character in *Amélie*. He caters to others especially well and turns the other cheek frequently. Sadly, he's given the brunt of the abuse in the film as well, possibly due to his disability, a portrayal that is unfortunately likely accurate.

However, his good deeds get him to the land of milk and cauliflower. After Amélie's ethically-ambiguous pranks, Collignon is shaken enough to relent some of the management to Lucien.

Yes, Collignon does indeed get his just desserts. A couple of times in the film, Amélie illegally invades his apartment and gaslights him by swapping toothpaste and changing his speed dial presets.

#### Joseph

Meanwhile, back at the ranch—Amélie's workplace, in this case—we have the situation of Joseph, the cassette-tape-eating stalker. He's a regular, not due to good coffee, but intending to fill the hole in his heart by meticulously recording the actions of his ex-girlfriend, Amélie's co-worker, Gina.

Despite his creepiness, Amélie decides to become a wingman and attempts to set him up with the cigarette counter clerk Georgette, a skittish hypochondriac.

Their mutual loneliness and horniness explode in one fit of earth-shaking passion in the bathroom and Joseph seems to be a changed man for a hot sec. But after he misconstrues an innocent gesture from Gina, he's back to his old ways and does not get a happy ending

#### Raphaël

Finally, there's Raphaël, Amélie's father. He's portrayed as being an flawed, average father, but kind enough. The one event that continues to haunt him is the death of his wife. Instead of living his life and traveling, a dream of both him and his wife's, he stays home and decorates a monument to his wife's urn. And while endearing, it indicates a man that is in need of some growth which Amélie happily tries to facilitate. She takes the pièce de résistance of his shrine, a polished-to-hell garden gnome, and sends him around the world, but in actuality to a travel agency for international photo ops.

This weird world tour strangely forces Raphaël to work through some trauma and grow. In the film's epilogue, he gets into a taxi with two portmanteaus to finally see the world.

#### Raymond

Raymond, an reproduction artist and Amélie's newfound confidant, is a bit of a mixed bag. He encourages Amélie to be self-assured in her blossoming romance with Nino, but also is not the nicest person in this story, exploding at Lucien in one particular scene for no particular reason. However, he appears to repair relations with Lucien and continues to mentor Amélie until she suceeds with Nino.

Thus, the audience is only exposed to hints of personal growth. Instead of painstakingly repainting Renoir's *Luncheon of the Boating Party* for the twentieth-odd time, he paints a Mexican muralist-esque version of it

#### Conclusion

Lucien and Raphaël get better endings than Collignon and Joseph for a reason. The film rewards compassionate masculinity as well as men that grow and change and doesn't reward those who remain bad-tempered.

### Amélie and Nino

And don't worry, I didn't forget about Nino. Amélie and he get their own section.

It's easy to dismiss the relationship dynamics between Amélie and Nino as traditional due to Amélie's debilitating shyness. It appears that Amélie is the one being pursued. But in fact, she is the one in control for the entire film. She creates the cat and mouse game that Nino has to follow while as she grapples with her shyness.

It's clear by the end that Amélie has grown and become a more confident person. Speaking of which, *Amélie*'s finale is one of the most feminist


People may be quick to dismiss Amélie's femininity as progressive due to her ultra-femme personality. Everything from her curtains to her hairstyle to her expressions are unabashedly feminine and contributes to the comfortable charm that the film is known and loved for. Even when Amélie intentionally harms others (albeit for justice), she does it with a smirk that reminds the audience of her non-threatening womanhood.

But her traditional feminine appearance is precisely why Amélie's gender performance is so progressive. Although more diverse butch depictions of femininity are necessary in the media, it is equally important to redefine the traits we assign to traditional femininity as well.
